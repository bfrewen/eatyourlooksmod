Some pages with documentation

1. Google's tutorial that uses the Google cloud version of lambdas to do the processing
https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/tutorials/ocr#objectives_1

    NOTE: worked through this tutorial and got it to work with their images and mine.

2. Tutorial for using the Vision API to find text and, more importantly, bounding boxes
https://medium.com/searce/tips-tricks-for-using-google-vision-api-for-text-detection-2d6d1e0c6361

3. Google's tutorial / how-to guide for finding text.
https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr

4. Above pairs with this quick-start gude for Vision client libraries.
https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/quickstart-client-libraries

5. Github project demo-ing how to use text detection
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-vision/tree/master/python/text

    NOTE: requires a Redis server

6. Google's tutorial for Document text detection. I think this still works with images, but is
   optimized for dense text. OR maybe it only works with document-type file types.
https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/fulltext-annotations

7. ** API documentation **
https://googleapis.dev/python/vision/latest/index.html

Some next steps

* I think I have exhausted resurce #3 which also used #4. Look at 2.
* 2. in progress (although reverted to https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/fulltext-annotations)
	* number the boxes DONE
	* extract the title
	* extract the list of ingredients (create resource list of ingredients)
